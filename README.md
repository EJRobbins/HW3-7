# HW3-7

Hello! 

Here's my code refactoring project. 

I just want to note that I was (severely) struggling with github, git push, and repos, so I used this assignment to mess around with folders, move things, and make a new repo. Truth be told I made a new repo because I accidentally copied my first repo into a second repo, but who cares, right? This is why almost everything is named blah blah blah *copy*.html. But it's fine.


So, to make my website more accessable, the first thing I wanted to do was check to make sure that there was an alt attribute on every image possible. To do this, I actually did move the background image from the CSS file, and put it as an img tag in the actual html file. I do not know if there's an easier way to do this? Or if I can add an alt to an element that is not img? But anywho, there it is. I made sure to keep the same image parameters to keep it from looking wonky. I also added alt attributes to all other logos and labels on the page. 


Next thing, which probably isn't necessary, and probably has no correlation to the ADA checklist whatsoever, is I made the a:hover black, to bring contrast when an image was scrolled over. I don't know if this would necessarily help a colorblind person (considering most people have issues with the red/green side of things and not grey, blue, brown and white). But thought it may be something to consider for future projects, and how I should set the color scheme for those. 


After this, I checked to make sure h1, h2 and h3 tags sat in the correct order. They were! (nice). I did actually attempt to make the first h1 tag a header tag, and in the midst of this, broke the code, realized I'd have to rip apart the already existing CSS file, and figured it wasn't worth it, and in this case, the h1 and header tag were probably (?) fine to be interchangeable. I also changed the bottom p tag to be a footer tag. 


Now that I am thinking about it, there's a good chance that it would have been a good idea for me to make clear the main section of the page vs the side section of the page using the names of the different classes? But, again, since the side items are marked by h3 tags, I am not sure that this truly matters, or would make a difference to someone with a screenreader. 


I left tons of space in between each paragraph here, and I am submitting this so early because I am looking for ALL the feedback. Don't be scared, I am very much a fan of constructive criticism, and suggestions on things I may not have seen. If I do not get a passing grade, or a good grade this time around, I will be using office hours to take a deeper look, and resubmit! 

Thanks (:
